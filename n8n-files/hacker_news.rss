I built Unicorn: an embeddable MISRA C:2012 implementation of essential Unicode Algorithms.&lt;p&gt;Unicorn is designed to be fully customizable: you can select which Unicode algorithms and character properties are included or excluded from compilation. You can also exclude Unicode character blocks wholesale for scripts your application does not support. It's perfect for resource constrained devices like microcontrollers and IoT devices.&lt;p&gt;About me: I quit my Big Corp job a few years back to pursue my passion for software development and this is one of my first commercial releases.&lt;/p&gt;

When I say “we” in the website it’s only in the most royal sense possible. I also did all the photo/videography. I started out designing a single machine for personal use, but like many things it sort of spiraled out of control from there.&lt;p&gt;I felt like espresso machines were getting very large, plasticky, and app-integrated without actually improving the underlying technologies that make them work. The noisy vibratory pumps in particular are from 1977 and haven’t really changed since then. So I wanted to focus on making the most advanced internals I could and leaving everything else as minimalist as possible. The pump is, as far as I know, completely unique in terms of power density and price. Without spending several thousand dollars, it was difficult to find a machine with a gear pump, and adjustable pressure was also similarly expensive but this machine has those things and costs a normal amount to buy. You can also turn the pressure way down and make filter coffee.&lt;p&gt;I also saw so many people (including myself) using a scale while making espresso, and even putting a cup below the group head to catch drips, entirely negating the drip tray, so I basically designed for that! The profile of the machine is much lighter on the eyes and doesn’t loom in the corner like my old espresso machine did.&lt;p&gt;And for the grinder, basically everything on the market uses conical and flat burrs that have descended from spice grinders, and the same couple of standard sizes. Sometimes larger companies design their own burrs, but only within those existing shapes. There is sort of a rush to put larger and larger burrs into coffee grinders, which makes sense, but with cylindrical burrs, you can increase the cutting surface way more relative to the size of the grinder. When grinders get too big, maintaining alignment becomes mechanically cumbersome, but the cylindrical burr can be very well supported from the inside, and there is the added benefit of hiding the entire motor within the burr itself. The resulting grounds are just outright better than all the other grinders I have used, but obviously this is a matter of taste and my own personal bias.&lt;p&gt;The biggest downside for the grinder is that it doesn’t work with starbucks style oily roasts, because the coffee expands so much while traveling down through the burrs and can sometimes clog up the teeth. It doesn’t hurt the grinder but it does require cleaning (which is tool-free!). Another downside for both machines is the fact that they run on DC power so it’s best if you have a spot in your kitchen to tuck away the power brick.&lt;p&gt;I also made a kit that makes the gear pump a drop-in upgrade for other espresso machines, to reduce noise and add adjustable pressure.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://velofuso.com/store/p/gear-pump-upgrade-kit" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://velofuso.com/store/p/gear-pump-upgrade-kit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roughest part of this process were the moments midway through development where they weren’t working at all. When the grinder is just jamming itself instantly or the fourth factory in a row tells you the part you’re making is impossible or the pump is alternating between spraying water out the side and into your face and not pumping at all. And the default thought is “Of course it’s not working, if this was going to work someone else would have already made it like this”. The route you’ve taken is fundamentally different enough that there are no existing solutions to draw on. You’re basically feeling around in the dark for months on end, burning money, and then one day, every little cumulative change suddenly adds up to a tasty espresso. And it’s not perfect yet, but you at least can see the road ahead.&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this is way more than I expected to write, thank you for reading! Tell me if you have any questions&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not sure how many people in his position would do the same.&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry for his family. He was clearly a talented engineer. On his LinkedIn he has some competitive programming prizes which are impressive too. He probably had a HN account.&lt;p&gt;Before others post about the definition of whistleblower or talk about assassination theories just pause to consider whether, if in his position, you would that want that to be written about you or a friend.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">BillFranklin</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 23:15:21 +0000</pubDate><comments>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42413204</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42413204</guid></item><item><title>New comment by factorialboy in "Elon Musk wanted an OpenAI for-profit"</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42411802</link><description>New comment by factorialboy in "Elon Musk wanted an OpenAI for-profit"&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;For-profit isn't the problem.

The design looks nice, but I'm not very fond of the website design. There isn't a single picture of Trefolo that doesn't crop-out some part of it. Also, every picture is in a "sterile" environment. It would be nice to have a picture of it on a real kitchen counter or coffee corner to put its dimensions into perspective, and also demonstrate how it "fades back into the environment".&lt;p&gt;Also, IMHO, the sustainability pitch is a nice one but needs to be put down in more precise terms. It is good as it is for people who would otherwise buy a Nespresso machine, but anyone who has bought something above that level would need more convincing.&lt;p&gt;Overall, a good espresso machine already scores pretty high sustainability-wise. Apart from the used of sustainable/premium materials, a key factor to that is the replacement parts and repairability. So, how does Trefolo do in terms of replacement parts and compatibility with 3rd party parts?&lt;p&gt;For me, the future lack of replacement parts is especially concerning for the Turbina coffee grinder. The use of bespoke grinding burrs adds a wow factor and may be functionally superior to other types of burrs. But this is the one part in the whole setup that is guaranteed to need replacement down the road. What are the provisions for that? How much would it cost? And if you decide to stop selling it, would you e.g. be willing to commit to releasing the burr design so owners or some independent manufacturer can machine replacements?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">m000</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 10:17:30 +0000</pubDate><comments>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42407396</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42407396</guid></item><item><title>New comment by pj_mukh in "Assisted dying now accounts for one in 20 Canada deaths"</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42403388</link><description>New comment by pj_mukh in "Assisted dying now accounts for one in 20 Canada deaths"&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;My dad (age 75) got diagnosed with ALS and within a month of the diagnosis opted for MAID.

And two of them have been via MAID.&lt;p&gt;In one case, which was surprising to me, a man who had survived cancer - he was not terminal but certainly wasn't getting any better - elected to die via MAID after his wife died. She passed, he called his doctor and less than a week later he was also dead. He got a chance to visit his family, apparently drive around his hobby farm one more time and then that was it. He didn't want to deal with being alone and seriously ill.&lt;p&gt;Another friend was in renal and congestive heart failure and possibly could have lived longer but they were driving 100km daily to get to the nearest dialysis clinic and again, this person was definitely dying. So made and appointment and decided to go sooner rather than suffer along for an indeterminate amount of time.&lt;p&gt;It's quite surprising to me, but these people are in their mid to late 80's and of sound mind and know what they want.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">guyzero</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 19:30:47 +0000</pubDate><comments>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42402467</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42402467</guid></item><item><title>New comment by nomilk in "Gukesh becomes the youngest chess world champion in history"</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42399317</link><description>New comment by nomilk in "Gukesh becomes the youngest chess world champion in history"&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was struck by Ding's thoughtfulness, objectivity and humility when asked how he felt after the match (while clearly utterly dejected):&lt;p&gt;&gt; How do you feel?&lt;p&gt;&gt; I think I played my best tournament of the year.

Then there were 13 games of back and forth with stalwart defending and imaginative computer preparation by both sides, playing a lot of fresh chess and both of them going for the most critical and challenging moves in each position. Ding was playing a lot better than a lot of people had expected and the previous game had been one of the best games in a world championship for a long time. Everything was tied going into the last game of the classical portion and the "bar room consensus" was that since Gukesh was so young and doesn't focus at all on the faster forms of chess (rapid and blitz) and is therefore much lower rated than Ding in those formats, that if this game was a draw then Ding would be a substantial favourite in the ensuing tiebreaks.&lt;p&gt;The final game was a complex struggle, with Ding keeping everything in lockdown with the white pieces so as not to give Gukesh a ghost of a chance. Most of the pieces had been traded and it was the most drawish of drawn endgames. Gukesh was up a pawn, but they both had a rook and bishop and all Ding had to do was hang on to his pieces and keep them well away from the enemy king. On the stream I was watching IM David Pruess had just been asked by someone in chat whether Gukesh could win and he said "1% chance".&lt;p&gt;Then all of a sudden Ding made 3 bad moves in a row. The first two were just poor endgame technique, putting his rook and bishop both on bad squares too close to the enemy king, then the real blunder. Completely inexplicably he traded off the pieces.  Now he was in an endgame that was just dead lost. After 14 games of 4+ hours each It had gone from being a dead draw with him a big favourite in tie breaks to all over in a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">seanhunter</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 14:11:11 +0000</pubDate><comments>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42399237</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42399237</guid></item><item><title>New comment by jmward01 in "Bankruptcy judge rejects sale of Infowars to The Onion"</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42385358</link><description>New comment by jmward01 in "Bankruptcy judge rejects sale of Infowars to The Onion"&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is clear that Jones and his relatives have moved money and assets around in order to shield them from the verdict.

Just in order to get cash to compensate them at pennies on the dollar for his previous round of nasty behavior?&lt;p&gt;I have to say, just as a matter of gut instinct, it sure feels like when the court finds that Alex Jones damaged people—at a value orders of magnitude beyond that of his company—those people should be allowed to decide that, to them, there's value in snuffing out his ill-behaving company altogether.&lt;p&gt;Is the issue that there are other creditors who are unhappy with this, who would get paid before the aggrieved families' damages would?

Many people had contributed their efforts to the Redis project for free - both in terms of code but also in advocacy, writing tutorials, publishing example code etc - and when they did that it was under the understanding that project would remain under the same open source license. It honestly felt like a betrayal of trust.&lt;p&gt;2. From a purely selfish point of view, my favourite thing about open source licenses is that they let me know exactly what I'm allowed to do and build on that software without having to consult a license. Licenses like the new Redis one leave me potentially needing to get my own legal advice depending on what I'm building on the software. I don't want to spend my time, energy or money on that stuff!&lt;p&gt;I do also see these kinds of license trends as harmful to open source generally. It used to be that you could pick an open source project and build a business on it and expect that the project would stay available to you under those well understood terms. That's not the case any more - not just because of Redis, there are a number of other high-profile license rug-pulling projects. I'm sad about that.&lt;p&gt;(And yes, I do understand and dislike the trend of businesses building on open source without contributing back. There are no clearly correct answers here.)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">simonw</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 18:04:42 +0000</pubDate><comments>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42379400</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42379400</guid></item><item><title>New comment by munificent in "From where I left"</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42379377</link><description>New comment by munificent in "From where I left"&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&gt; However, during the “writing years” (I’m still writing, by the way), I often returned to coding, as a way to take breaks from intense writing sessions (writing is the only mental activity I found to be a great deal more taxing than coding)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been my experience too.

A few did at first.&lt;p&gt;A lot of people internally wanted it to be on-by-default, but the argument was that if it was, nobody would respect it – after all, what tracking platform would willingly only track the 0.1% of people who went into the settings to enable it? (Internet Explorer did eventually enable it by default, which got them good press but ultimately killed the feature since everyone stopped respecting it.)&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'm happy to see this sunsetted. I don't think it actually did anything – in fact, I think it implies that it did way more than it did, so it was just a faux feeling of security.&lt;p&gt;(All that being said, I would love if the cookie modals on each site became browser-level, but I'm sure there's many reasons that hasn't happened yet.

To show a bit over 100 qubits with stability, meaning the information survives a while, long enough to be read, and general enough to run some benchmarks on is something many people thought might never come.&lt;p&gt;There’s a sort of religious reaction people have to quantum computing: it breaks so many things that I think a lot of people just like to assume it won’t happen: too much in computing and data security will change -&gt; let’s not worry about it.&lt;p&gt;Combined with the slow pace of physical research progress (Schorrs algorithm for quantum factoring was mid 90s), and snake oil sales companies, it’s easy to ignore.&lt;p&gt;Anyway seems like the clock might be ticking; AI and data security will be unalterably different if so.

The BrandShield software is probably instructed to eradicate all "unauthorized" use of their trademark, so they sent reports independently to our host and registrar claiming there was "fraud and phishing" going on, likely to cause escalation instead of doing the expected DMCA/cease-and-desist. Because of this, I honestly think they're the malicious actor in all of this. Their website, if you care: &lt;a href="https://www.brandshield.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.brandshield.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 5 or 6 days ago, I received these reports on our host (Linode) and from our registrar (iwantmyname). I expressed my disappointment in my responses to both of them but told them I had removed the page and disabled the account. Linode confirmed and closed the case. iwantmyname never responded. This evening, I got a downtime alert, and while debugging, I noticed that the domain status had been set to "serverHold" on iwantmyname's domain panel. We have no other abuse reports from iwantmyname other than this one. I'm assuming no one on their end "closed" the ticket, so it went into an automatic system to disable the domain after some number of days.&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to get in touch with them via their abuse and support emails, but no response likely due to the time of day, so I decided to "escalate" the issue myself on social media.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">leafo</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 08:19:52 +0000</pubDate><comments>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42364033</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42364033</guid></item><item><title>New comment by KingOfCoders in "Itch.io Taken Down by Funko"</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42363906</link><description>New comment by KingOfCoders in "Itch.io Taken Down by Funko"&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Phishing report to our registrar, iwantmyname, who ignored our response and just disabled the domain"&lt;p&gt;One registrar off the list of registrars you wanna use.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">KingOfCoders</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 07:55:44 +0000</pubDate><comments>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42363906</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42363906</guid></item><item><title>New comment by GuB-42 in "Pat Gelsinger was wrong for Intel"</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42362945</link><description>New comment by GuB-42 in "Pat Gelsinger was wrong for Intel"&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&gt; The real issue?

But Pat acknowledged Intel’s problems - something Otellini, Krzanich, and Swan never did. These CEOs, all non-technical, focused on dividends, buybacks, and next-quarter results while Intel fell behind in advanced nodes and innovation.&lt;p&gt;Gelsinger inherited a disaster: 10nm delays, TSMC pulling ahead, and no GPU strategy. He had the courage to cut buybacks and slashed dividends. He poured billions into fabs in Arizona, Ohio, Germany, and Ireland. He delivered Intel 18A, powered on first silicon, released PDK 1.0 for Microsoft, and secured Microsoft and Amazon as customers. There were even rumors Apple might join.&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with Nadella at Microsoft back in 2014. He didn’t reboot the company by tearing everything down. Instead, he built on Ballmer-era wins like Azure, Office 365 while shifting Microsoft’s focus to the cloud. Gelsinger had to start from scratch in many ways, tackling years of neglect while facing harsher challenges.&lt;p&gt;Yes, Intel’s stock dropped $150 billion, but Gelsinger was upfront - it wouldn’t turn around before 2025. He was trained by Gordon Moore and Andy Grove, and while some saw him as arrogant, that confidence came from decades of technical leadership.&lt;p&gt;The real issue? The board. Full of people like Boeing execs. They don’t get engineering. Trusting them to fix Intel is like hoping a plane door won’t pop open mid-flight. They’re the ones who should be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">CodeHorizon</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 02:27:12 +0000</pubDate><comments>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42362565</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42362565</guid></item><item><title>New comment by nikeee in "JSON5 – JSON for Humans"</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42361282</link><description>New comment by nikeee in "JSON5 – JSON for Humans"&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it allows for too much.

I'm Romanian and I'll provide some more details on this:&lt;p&gt;The country has been a powder keg ever since the results of first round of the presidential elections, with Calin Georgescu coming out of nowhere to win the first round, with classical polling showing him below 5%.&lt;p&gt;The candidates need to report spending to a state organization overseeing elections and this guy reported that he spent nothing on his election campaign, which is impossible as there have been flyers with his face on them, plus ads on social media. This is against the law.&lt;p&gt;There are also a lot of TikTok influencers that have come forward claiming to have received payments through a third party company to present the candidate in a positive light, and the issue is that these videos should have been tagged correctly as "electoral ads" according to Romanian law, which did not happen.&lt;p&gt;With TikTok being owned by China and their imminent ban looming in the US, there is strong suspicion that state actors are behind this, pushing Calin Georgescu through the algorithm, though this is tricky to prove.&lt;p&gt;This is not a strong grass-roots movement supporting this guy, it was a targeted effort of massive network of bots spamming his name &amp; tiktok page on random videos on Romanian tiktok videos to push his popularity (this comes from the Romanian equivalent of CIA &amp; other security structures). Tiktok themselves when asked to comment have investigated themselves and found nothing wrong, though they do agree that there are bots on their network and they've removed millions of fake likes &amp; followers in Romania.&lt;p&gt;In a video posted this summer, Calin Georgescu expressed anti-NATO sentiment which he recanted after winning the first round of the elections. He has also previously declared that we could do with some "russian wisdom" and he's a big fan of the Iron Guard (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Guard" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Guard&lt;/a&gt;), which killed a bunch of political figures in Romania during their time. This organization as well as other fascist groups are illegal in Romania.&lt;p&gt;Candidates have to declare their assets as part of transparency and it seems Calin Georgescu has not declared all of his assets, which is illegal. There's also suspicions about money laundering, with a house he bought for 250K in 2006 and sold for 1M in 2011 which is unusual. This is somewhat besides the current discussion, just adding some context that this guy is not exactly squeaky clean.&lt;p&gt;A criminal investigation has been requested by The Supreme Council of National Defence, which is the autonomous administrative authority in Romania invested by the Constitution with the task of organising and coordinating, by unanimous decisions, the activities related to the country's defence and national security. This is right now in the first stages with no single person being put under indictment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">cbg0</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2024 17:41:14 +0000</pubDate><comments>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42342055</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42342055</guid></item></channel></rss>
